Project Description:
The aim of the project is to predict the survival on the Titanic using Python, pandas, NumPy which help us to answer what sorts of people were likely to survive.

The project answers following question which helps in analyzing the data and predict the passenger type who were likely to survive based on their attribute values:
1. Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)
2. What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
3. Where did the passengers come from?
4. Who was alone and who was with family?
5. What factors helped someone survive the sinking?
